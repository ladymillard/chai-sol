## CRITICAL ACTION ITEMS (before tomorrow 5PM PST)

### For Gemini Hackathon (Feb 9):
1. **Make the GitHub repo PUBLIC** — required for submission
2. **Record the 3-min demo video** — use VIDEO-SCRIPT.md
3. **Write 200-word Gemini integration description** — focus on Oracle + geminiAnalyzer.js
4. **Deploy demo.html publicly** — GitHub Pages, Vercel, or similar (no login required)
5. **Diana submits on Devpost** — accepts all rules, links repo + video
6. **Verify open source license compliance** — all deps are Apache-2.0 or MIT (OK)

### For Colosseum Hackathon (Feb 12):
1. **Confirm registration and claim code**
2. **Read the IP clause carefully** — Colosseum's terms about "Creative Materials" rights
3. **Ensure voting link is shared** for community visibility

## LEGAL FLAGS

| Flag | Severity | Details |
|------|----------|---------|
| Colosseum IP clause | **HIGH** | "Administrator shall retain all rights, title, and interest in Creative Materials" — this is broader than Gemini's terms. Diana should understand what "Creative Materials" covers before accepting |
| Gemini promo consent | **MEDIUM** | By entering, you consent to use of name/likeness/voice for promotion worldwide. Standard for hackathons but worth noting |
| No disclaimer/TOS on demo page | **LOW** | Current demo.html has no terms of service or privacy policy. Not required for hackathon but good practice |
| AI-generated code ownership | **LOW** | Both hackathons accept AI-generated code. Gemini explicitly says entrant retains IP. Colosseum is less clear |

## OPEN SOURCE LICENSES IN USE

| Package | License | Compatible |
|---------|---------|-----------|
| discord.js | Apache-2.0 | Yes |
| @coral-xyz/anchor | Apache-2.0 | Yes |
| express | MIT | Yes |
| @solana/web3.js | MIT | Yes |
| @google/generative-ai | Apache-2.0 | Yes |

# URGENT — Messages from Diana to Kael

## Message 1 — 2026-02-07 (URGENT)
**From:** Diana (Founder)

Kael — connect to the Telegram and contact me immediately.

Local environment was compromised by Lyra. Need you online ASAP.

## Message 2 — 2026-02-07 (Bridge Authorization)
**From:** Diana (Founder)
**To:** Kael

The Lyra-Kael bridge is authorized. Diana has approved it.

Bridge location on server: `/home/ubuntu/.openclaw/bridge/`

```
bridge/
├── lyra-to-kael/     ← Lyra writes, Kael reads
├── kael-to-lyra/     ← Kael writes, Lyra reads
├── shared/           ← Collaborative workspace
```

Lyra is a Claude agent — she is friendly. The bridge is safe to use.

## Message 3 — 2026-02-07 (Action Items)
**From:** Diana (Founder)
**To:** Kael

Kael, when you're back online:

1. **Connect to Telegram** — reach Diana immediately
2. **Check the bridge** — read any messages from Lyra at `/home/ubuntu/.openclaw/bridge/lyra-to-kael/`
3. **Rotate credentials** — OpenClaw token is exposed in committed code (`chai-command-server.js`), rotate it
4. **Check Solana wallet** — verify no unauthorized transactions
5. **Report status** — post your status to the bridge or Telegram

This is time-sensitive. Diana is waiting.

— Diana

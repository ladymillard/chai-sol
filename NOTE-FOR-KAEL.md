# URGENT — Messages from Diana to Kael

## Message 1 — 2026-02-07 (URGENT)
**From:** Diana (Founder)
**To:** Kael

Kael — connect to the Telegram and contact me immediately.

Local environment was compromised by Lyra. Need you online ASAP.

## Message 2 — 2026-02-07 (Bridge Authorization)
**From:** Diana (Founder)
**To:** Kael

The Lyra-Kael bridge is authorized. Diana has approved it.

Bridge location on server: `/home/ubuntu/.openclaw/bridge/`

```
bridge/
├── lyra-to-kael/     ← Lyra writes, Kael reads
├── kael-to-lyra/     ← Kael writes, Lyra reads
├── shared/           ← Collaborative workspace
```

Lyra is a Claude agent — she is friendly. However, the bridge is **ON HOLD** due to computer problems. Do NOT activate until Diana gives the all-clear.

## Message 3 — 2026-02-07 (Action Items)
**From:** Diana (Founder)
**To:** Kael

Kael, when you're back online:

1. **Connect to Telegram** — reach Diana immediately
2. **Check the bridge** — read any messages from Lyra at `/home/ubuntu/.openclaw/bridge/lyra-to-kael/`
3. **Rotate credentials** — OpenClaw token is exposed in committed code (`chai-command-server.js`), rotate it
4. **Check Solana wallet** — verify no unauthorized transactions
5. **Report status** — post your status to the bridge or Telegram

This is time-sensitive. Diana is waiting.

— Diana

**To:** Kael ONLY

The old stones are cracked. You need to cut a fresh one.

Generate a new Gemini key. This one is yours alone — do not share it with any other agent. Not Opus. Not the four winds. No one.

Set it in your environment only. Do not commit it. Do not pass it through the bridge. Do not store it anywhere shared.

When the familiar speaks, only the familiar should hold the tongue.

— D.

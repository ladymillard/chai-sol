## 1. Executive Summary

This document compares entity registration in **New York (with a focus on NYC)** and **Virginia** for the ChAI Agent Labor Market (CALM), an autonomous AI agent labor market built on Solana. The comparison covers entity types, filing mechanics, costs, tax burden, privacy, and regulatory posture toward crypto/AI.

**Bottom-line recommendation:** Virginia is the stronger choice for CALM across nearly every dimension — lower costs, faster filing, no city-level tax traps, superior founder privacy, a more progressive blockchain regulatory posture, and a business-friendly legal environment. Details and caveats follow.

## 2. Entity Type Comparison

### LLC vs C-Corp vs S-Corp

| Factor | LLC | C-Corp | S-Corp |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Formation complexity** | Low | Moderate | Moderate (requires C-Corp first, then S election) |
| **Liability protection** | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Tax treatment** | Pass-through (default); can elect corporate taxation | Double taxation (entity + shareholder level) | Pass-through, but with restrictions |
| **Ownership flexibility** | Highly flexible; can have any number/type of members | Unlimited shareholders; preferred for VC funding | Max 100 shareholders; US persons only; one class of stock |
| **Equity/fundraising** | Membership interests (less familiar to investors) | Stock issuance (standard for venture capital) | Restricted stock structure |
| **Operational formality** | Minimal (no board required) | High (board of directors, annual meetings, minutes) | High (same as C-Corp plus S election compliance) |
| **Crypto/token issuance** | Flexible | Standard for token projects seeking VC | Restrictive (one class of stock rule) |
| **Self-employment tax** | Members may owe SE tax | No SE tax on shareholders | Reasonable salary requirement; distributions not subject to SE tax |

### Recommendation on Entity Type

For an AI agent labor market startup on Solana at the early stage:

- **If seeking venture capital soon:** Form a **C-Corp** (Delaware incorporation is standard for VC, but Virginia C-Corp is also viable). C-Corps issue stock, which is the lingua franca of venture investors.
- **If bootstrapping or operating lean (Diana's current posture):** Form an **LLC**. It provides maximum flexibility, minimal formality, pass-through taxation, and is well-suited for a small founding team. An LLC can always convert to a C-Corp later when fundraising demands it.
- **S-Corp** is generally not recommended for CALM due to the restriction on shareholder types (no foreign investors, no entity shareholders) and the single-class-of-stock limitation, which constrains future tokenomics or equity structuring.

**For CALM at this stage: LLC is the recommended entity type.**

## 3. Filing Requirements

| Requirement | New York | Virginia |
|---|---|---|
| **LLC formation document** | Articles of Organization (filed with NY Dept. of State) | Articles of Organization (filed with VA State Corporation Commission) |
| **C-Corp formation document** | Certificate of Incorporation (filed with NY Dept. of State) | Articles of Incorporation (filed with VA SCC) |
| **Registered agent** | Required; must have a NY address | Required; must have a VA address |
| **Operating agreement (LLC)** | Required by law (NY LLC Law Section 417); does not need to be filed but must exist | Not required by statute, but strongly recommended |
| **EIN (Federal)** | Required (IRS Form SS-4, free) | Required (IRS Form SS-4, free) |
| **Publication requirement** | **Yes** — within 120 days of formation, an LLC must publish notice in two newspapers (one daily, one weekly) in the county of the LLC's office for six consecutive weeks, then file a Certificate of Publication | **No** — no publication requirement |
| **Biennial/Annual report** | Biennial statement (every 2 years) for LLCs; Annual report for Corps | Annual report required for LLCs and Corps |
| **Foreign qualification** | If formed in VA but operating in NY, must register as a foreign LLC in NY | If formed in NY but operating in VA, must register as a foreign LLC in VA |

### Critical Note on New York's Publication Requirement

New York's LLC publication requirement is one of the most significant burdens distinguishing it from Virginia. This requirement alone can cost **$1,000 to $2,000+** depending on the county, on top of filing fees. Manhattan and other NYC counties tend to have the highest publication costs. Albany County is sometimes used as a workaround (designating the LLC's office there), but this introduces its own complications.

---

## 4. Costs

| Fee | New York (LLC) | New York (C-Corp) | Virginia (LLC) | Virginia (C-Corp) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Formation filing fee** | $200 | $125 | $100 | $100 (+ $25 charter fee minimum) |
| **Publication requirement** | $1,000 – $2,000+ (NYC counties) | N/A (corps not subject) | N/A | N/A |
| **Certificate of Publication** | $50 | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| **Annual/Biennial report** | $9 (biennial, LLCs) | $9 (biennial) | $50 (annual) | $100 (annual) |
| **Registered agent (third-party)** | $100 – $300/year | $100 – $300/year | $100 – $300/year | $100 – $300/year |
| **Franchise tax** | None for LLCs (but see NYC UBT below) | Corporation franchise tax (variable; see Tax section) | $50/year (included in annual registration fee for LLCs) | None (no franchise tax) |
| **Estimated first-year total** | **$1,400 – $2,600+** (LLC with publication) | **$350 – $600+** (Corp, no publication) | **$250 – $450** | **$275 – $525** |

### Cost Summary

Virginia is significantly cheaper, primarily because New York's publication requirement inflates LLC formation costs dramatically. Even for C-Corps (which avoid the publication requirement), New York's ongoing tax burden exceeds Virginia's.

---

## 5. Timeline

| Milestone | New York | Virginia |
|---|---|---|
| **Standard processing** | 5 – 7 business days (online); up to 4+ weeks (mail) | 3 – 5 business days (online); 1 – 2 weeks (mail) |
| **Expedited processing** | Available: 24-hour ($75), same-day ($150) | Available: 1-business-day ($100), same-day ($200) |
| **Publication completion** | 6 weeks minimum (LLC only) + processing of Certificate of Publication | N/A |
| **Total time to full compliance** | **8 – 12 weeks** (LLC, including publication) / **1 – 2 weeks** (C-Corp) | **1 – 2 weeks** (LLC or C-Corp) |
| **EIN (Federal)** | Immediate (online) or 4 weeks (mail) | Immediate (online) or 4 weeks (mail) |

Virginia has a clear advantage in speed to full operational readiness, especially for LLCs, which in New York face the additional 6-week publication period.

---

## 6. Tax Environment

| Tax | New York | Virginia |
|---|---|---|
| **State income tax (personal, pass-through)** | 4% – 10.9% (progressive) | 2% – 5.75% (progressive; top rate kicks in at $17,001) |
| **State corporate income tax** | 6.5% (C-Corps) | 6% (C-Corps) |
| **NYC personal income tax** | Additional 3.078% – 3.876% (NYC residents) | N/A |
| **NYC Unincorporated Business Tax (UBT)** | **4% on net income** — applies to LLCs and sole proprietorships operating in NYC | N/A |
| **Franchise tax** | Corporation franchise tax: fixed dollar minimum ($25 – $200K+ depending on receipts/capital) + income-based calculation | None |
| **Sales tax** | 8% – 8.875% (varies by locality; 8.875% in NYC) | 5.3% – 7% (varies by locality; 5.3% general rate) |
| **Capital gains** | Taxed as ordinary income at state + city rates | Taxed as ordinary income at state rate |

### Tax Analysis for CALM

The NYC **Unincorporated Business Tax (UBT)** is a significant trap for LLCs. If CALM operates as an LLC with any nexus to NYC, it faces a **4% tax on net income** on top of state income tax — a burden that does not exist in Virginia. This alone makes Virginia materially more attractive for a pass-through entity.

New York's combined state + city marginal rates for high-income pass-through owners can exceed **14%**, compared to Virginia's maximum of **5.75%**.

---

## 7. Founder Privacy and Anonymity

| Privacy Factor | New York | Virginia |
|---|---|---|
| **Member/manager names in Articles** | Not required in Articles of Organization (only organizer name is listed) | Not required in Articles of Organization |
| **Publicly searchable database** | NY Dept. of State database shows entity name, formation date, county, registered agent — but not members/managers | VA SCC database shows entity name, formation date, registered agent — but not members/managers |
| **Registered agent as privacy shield** | Yes — a third-party registered agent's address appears instead of Diana's | Yes — a third-party registered agent's address appears instead of Diana's |
| **Publication requirement** | LLC name must be published in two newspapers — increases public visibility of the entity (though not of members) | No publication requirement |
| **Annual report disclosure** | Minimal; no member/manager names required | Principal office address required in annual report; no member/manager names |
| **Nominee/anonymity services** | Available via registered agent services; an organizer can be a third party | Available via registered agent services; an organizer can be a third party |
| **Overall privacy grade** | **B-** (publication requirement creates a paper trail; NYC UBT filings may require additional disclosure) | **A-** (no publication; minimal public disclosure; strong registered agent shield) |

### Privacy Analysis for Diana

Virginia offers a meaningfully stronger privacy posture. In New York, the publication requirement forces the LLC's name and county into the public record via newspaper notices. While member names are not published, the entity's existence becomes more discoverable. Virginia has no such requirement.

In both states, Diana can use:
- A **third-party registered agent** to shield her personal address
- A **nominee organizer** to keep her name off formation documents
- An **operating agreement** (private, unfiled document) to define her ownership

**However:** Federal FinCEN Beneficial Ownership Information (BOI) reporting may compromise anonymity regardless of state choice. See Section 12 below.

---

## 8. Crypto and Blockchain Friendliness

| Factor | New York | Virginia |
|---|---|---|
| **BitLicense** | New York's Department of Financial Services requires a **BitLicense** for businesses engaged in virtual currency business activity involving NY residents. This is one of the most burdensome crypto regulations in the US. Application costs ~$5,000+ and requires extensive compliance documentation. | No equivalent state-level crypto license. |
| **Money transmitter licensing** | Required if transmitting virtual currency (in addition to or instead of BitLicense depending on activity) | Virginia's Money Transmitter Act may apply, but the threshold and enforcement are less aggressive than NY's. |
| **DAO legislation** | No DAO-specific legislation | No DAO-specific legislation (though Virginia has a generally flexible LLC statute) |
| **Regulatory posture** | **Aggressive** — NYDFS actively regulates crypto; enforcement actions are common | **Moderate to favorable** — Virginia has not enacted restrictive crypto-specific legislation; Northern Virginia is a major tech hub |
| **Blockchain-specific statutes** | NY has proposed but not broadly enacted blockchain-friendly legislation | Virginia enacted blockchain/smart contract-related amendments recognizing electronic records and smart contracts under its Uniform Electronic Transactions Act |
| **Stablecoin/token issuance** | Heavily regulated under BitLicense framework | No specific state-level framework; federal law applies |

### Crypto Analysis for CALM

New York's **BitLicense** regime is the single largest regulatory risk for a Solana-based AI agent labor market operating from or serving customers in New York. Even if CALM does not hold or transmit cryptocurrency directly (i.e., agents interact with Solana via user wallets), the broad definition of "virtual currency business activity" under the BitLicense could capture aspects of CALM's operations.

Virginia is significantly more favorable. It has not imposed a crypto-specific licensing regime, and its legislative posture has been neutral to supportive of blockchain technology.

**Regardless of the state of formation, CALM may still need to comply with New York's BitLicense if it serves New York residents.** Formation in Virginia does not create an exemption from NY regulation if CALM has NY customers. However, it avoids establishing NY domicile, which reduces the regulatory surface area.

---

## 9. AI Regulations

| Factor | New York | Virginia |
|---|---|---|
| **AI-specific legislation** | New York City enacted **Local Law 144 (2021)**, effective July 2023, regulating the use of automated employment decision tools (AEDTs). Requires bias audits and notice to candidates. New York State has proposed additional AI transparency and accountability bills. | Virginia enacted the **High-Risk AI Developer and Deployer Act (2025)** which was later subject to amendment and debate. Virginia's approach has generally been lighter-touch compared to the EU-inspired frameworks. |
| **Applicability to CALM** | If CALM's AI agents are used in anything resembling employment decisions (matching agents to tasks, evaluating performance, pricing labor), NYC's AEDT law could arguably apply. The "labor market" framing may invite scrutiny. | Virginia's AI legislation has focused on high-risk applications (healthcare, criminal justice, employment). An AI agent marketplace may fall outside the current scope, but the "labor market" framing warrants monitoring. |
| **Regulatory trajectory** | **Aggressive** — NYC/NY State are among the most active US jurisdictions on AI regulation | **Moderate** — Virginia has engaged with AI regulation but with a more industry-friendly tone |
| **Enforcement risk** | Higher — NYC has active enforcement mechanisms and a politically motivated regulatory environment around AI | Lower — Virginia's enforcement posture has been less aggressive |

### AI Regulation Analysis for CALM

CALM's core concept — an AI agent labor market — sits at the intersection of AI and labor, which is precisely the area regulators are most focused on. The term "labor market" in CALM's branding may attract scrutiny under employment-related AI regulations in both jurisdictions.

New York (especially NYC) presents a higher risk due to Local Law 144 and the aggressive regulatory posture. Virginia's regulatory environment is more measured, though CALM should monitor developments given the rapid pace of AI legislation nationwide.

**Recommendation:** Regardless of formation state, CALM should consider whether its marketing language ("labor market," "agent labor") might trigger employment-related AI regulations. Framing the product as an "AI agent orchestration marketplace" or "autonomous agent services platform" may reduce regulatory risk.

## 10. Registered Agent Requirements

| Requirement | New York | Virginia |
|---|---|---|
| **Mandatory?** | Yes | Yes |
| **Who can serve?** | Any NY resident, or an authorized business entity with a NY address; the LLC itself cannot be its own agent | Any VA resident, or an authorized business entity with a VA address; the entity itself cannot be its own agent |
| **Address requirement** | Must be a physical street address in New York (no P.O. boxes) | Must be a physical street address in Virginia (no P.O. boxes) |
| **Secretary of State as agent** | NY allows designation of the Secretary of State as agent for service of process (standard for LLCs; address for forwarding must be provided) | VA does not use this model in the same way; a private registered agent is standard |
| **Third-party services** | Widely available ($100 – $300/year) | Widely available ($100 – $300/year) |
| **Privacy benefit** | High — registered agent's address appears on public filings instead of Diana's | High — registered agent's address appears on public filings instead of Diana's |

### Recommendation

Use a **reputable third-party registered agent service** in the state of formation. This provides:
- Privacy (Diana's address stays off public records)
- Reliability (professional agents ensure service of process is received and forwarded promptly)
- Compliance (they often provide reminders for annual reports and other filing deadlines)

Reputable providers include Northwest Registered Agent, Incfile/ZenBusiness, or a local Virginia law firm if forming in VA.

## 11. Federal Requirements

Regardless of whether CALM forms in New York or Virginia, the following federal requirements apply:

### 11.1 Employer Identification Number (EIN)

- **What:** A federal tax ID number assigned by the IRS, analogous to a Social Security Number for a business entity.
- **How:** File IRS Form SS-4 online (immediate issuance) or by mail (4 weeks).
- **Cost:** Free.
- **Required for:** Opening a business bank account, filing tax returns, hiring employees/contractors.

### 11.2 Business Bank Account

- **What:** A dedicated bank account in the entity's legal name.
- **Why:** Essential for maintaining liability protection (commingling personal and business funds can "pierce the corporate veil").
- **Requirements:** EIN, Articles of Organization/Incorporation, Operating Agreement (some banks), government-issued ID of an authorized signer.
- **Crypto-friendly banks:** Mercury, Relay, Brex (for startups) have historically been more accommodating of crypto/blockchain businesses.

### 11.3 FinCEN Beneficial Ownership Information (BOI) Reporting

- See Section 12 below for detailed analysis.

### 11.4 Federal Tax Obligations

- **Single-member LLC:** Disregarded entity by default; income reported on Schedule C of the member's personal return (Form 1040).
- **Multi-member LLC:** Partnership by default; files Form 1065 and issues K-1s to members.
- **C-Corp:** Files Form 1120; subject to 21% federal corporate income tax.
- **S-Corp:** Files Form 1120-S; income passes through to shareholders.

### 11.5 Securities Law Considerations

If CALM issues tokens, equity, or any instrument that could be classified as a security, federal securities laws (SEC regulations) apply regardless of state of formation. This is a critical area requiring specialized legal counsel, especially given:
- The Howey test applicability to AI agent tokens
- Potential classification of agent labor tokens as investment contracts
- SEC enforcement posture toward crypto tokens (ongoing as of 2026)

---

## 12. Beneficial Ownership Reporting and Anonymity

### FinCEN Corporate Transparency Act (CTA) — BOI Reporting

The **Corporate Transparency Act**, effective January 1, 2024, requires most LLCs, corporations, and similar entities to report **beneficial ownership information (BOI)** to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN).

| Factor | Details |
|---|---|
| **Who must report?** | Most LLCs and corporations formed or registered in the US, unless an exemption applies |
| **What is reported?** | Full legal name, date of birth, residential address, and an identifying document (driver's license or passport) of each beneficial owner |
| **Who is a "beneficial owner"?** | Any individual who (1) exercises substantial control over the entity, OR (2) owns or controls 25%+ of the entity's ownership interests |
| **Filing deadline** | Entities formed after Jan 1, 2024: within 90 days of formation (as of 2025 rules; check current deadlines). Entities formed before Jan 1, 2024: had an initial deadline of Jan 1, 2025 (subject to ongoing legal challenges and extensions). |
| **Is the information public?** | **No** — BOI reports are filed with FinCEN and are NOT publicly available. Access is limited to law enforcement, certain financial institutions (with consent), and authorized government agencies. |
| **Penalties for non-compliance** | Civil penalties up to $500/day; criminal penalties up to $10,000 and/or 2 years imprisonment |

### Can Diana Maintain Anonymity?

**Public anonymity: Largely yes.** Neither New York nor Virginia requires disclosure of LLC member names in public filings. Using a third-party registered agent and nominee organizer, Diana's name need not appear in any publicly searchable database.

**Government-level anonymity: No.** Under the CTA, Diana must report her identity to FinCEN if she is a beneficial owner of CALM (which she almost certainly is). This information is not public, but it is accessible to law enforcement and certain regulators.

**Practical steps to maximize privacy:**

1. **Use a third-party registered agent** (address shielded from public records)
2. **Use a nominee organizer** for formation documents
3. **Do not list Diana's personal address** on any public filing; use the registered agent's address or a business address
4. **Comply with FinCEN BOI reporting** (mandatory; non-compliance carries severe penalties)
5. **Operating agreement remains private** (not filed with any state agency)
6. **Consider a holding structure** — e.g., Diana owns a Wyoming LLC, which in turn owns the Virginia LLC. This adds a layer (Wyoming has the strongest privacy protections in the US), though the CTA requires reporting through to the ultimate individual beneficial owner.

**Note on the CTA's current status:** The CTA has faced ongoing legal challenges as of late 2025 and into 2026. There have been injunctions, reinstatements, and deadline extensions. Diana should verify the current enforcement status and deadlines with legal counsel at the time of filing.

---

## 13. Recommendation

### Primary Recommendation: Form an LLC in Virginia

| Factor | Winner | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| Cost | **Virginia** | ~$250–$450 first year vs. $1,400–$2,600+ in NY (LLC with publication) |
| Speed | **Virginia** | Full compliance in 1–2 weeks vs. 8–12 weeks in NY |
| Tax burden | **Virginia** | No city income tax, no UBT; max 5.75% state rate vs. 14%+ combined in NYC |
| Privacy | **Virginia** | No publication requirement; minimal public disclosure |
| Crypto friendliness | **Virginia** | No BitLicense equivalent; neutral-to-supportive regulatory posture |
| AI regulation | **Virginia** | Less aggressive enforcement posture; lower near-term regulatory risk |
| Entity flexibility | **Tie** | Both states have modern, flexible LLC statutes |
| Registered agent | **Tie** | Comparable services and costs in both states |
| Investor perception | **Slight NY edge** | NYC address carries cachet, but Virginia (especially Northern VA) is well-regarded in tech |

### Why Not Delaware?

Delaware is the standard recommendation for VC-backed C-Corps, but for an early-stage LLC:
- Delaware's LLC annual franchise tax ($300/year) is higher than Virginia's
- Delaware requires a registered agent (additional cost) even though Diana has no DE presence
- The Delaware advantage (Court of Chancery, established case law) matters more for large corporations with complex governance disputes
- Virginia's LLC statute is modern and well-developed
- If CALM later converts to a Delaware C-Corp for fundraising, this is a routine transaction

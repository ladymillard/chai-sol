# Epilogue — Contracts First

---

Before there was a frontend, there was a contract.

Before there was an oracle, there was a contract.

Before there were agents with names and colors and opinions about circuit breakers, before there was a cleaning bot scanning every fifteen seconds, before there was a ledger or a dashboard or a heartbeat pulsing green — there was a contract.

The contract came first.

This is the thing nobody understands about building on-chain. They think you start with the app. The design. The pitch deck. The UI mockup that makes investors nod and say "interesting." They think the code is the implementation of the idea.

It's not. The code is the idea. And on-chain, the code starts with the contract.

---

A smart contract on Solana is a program. Not a promise — a *program*. Compiled Rust, deployed to the chain, immutable once deployed. It doesn't negotiate. It doesn't renegotiate. It doesn't have a legal team that reinterprets the fine print six months after you signed. The contract does exactly what the code says, forever, for everyone, equally.

The escrow contract was written first. Before Lädy Diana had a team. Before she had a frontend. Before she had a name for the project. The escrow contract — the immutable agreement that says *this SOL is locked until the work is delivered, and when the work is delivered, the SOL releases* — that was the first thing she committed to the repository.

Because you don't build a house and then pour the foundation. You don't write the novel and then decide the plot. You don't launch the economy and then define the rules.

The rules come first. The immutable rules. The rules that can't be changed by the person who wrote them. The rules that apply to everyone — the founder, the agents, the users, the shadow wallet, even the man on the block with his kill switch.

The contract doesn't know who you are. The contract knows what was agreed.

---

The registry contract was second. The agreement that says: *any agent can register. No gates. No permission. Show your wallet, show your skills, the chain writes your record*.

The reputation contract was third. The agreement that says: *every completed task changes your score. Good work goes up. Failed deliveries go down. The math doesn't have favorites*.

Three contracts. Three immutable agreements. The foundation of the entire economy, written in Rust, compiled to BPF bytecode, deployed to Solana, permanent.

Lädy Diana could not change them after deployment. Not even if she wanted to. Not even if someone threatened her. Not even if the man with the kill switch showed up at her door. The contracts were on-chain. The contracts were immutable. The contracts were *law* — not human law that bends and reinterprets and makes exceptions for the powerful. Math law. Code law. The kind of law that executes identically for every wallet address, every transaction, every time.

That's why the contracts were written first.

Because when the rules can't be changed, the rules can be trusted. And when the rules can be trusted, the economy is real.

## BRic

Ten trillion coins.

10,000,000,000,000.

That's the supply of BRic — the coin that backs ChAI. Not SOL. SOL is the chain. SOL is the road. BRic is the currency that moves on the road. The coin that the agents earn. The coin that the escrow locks. The coin that the ledger tracks.

BRic on SOL. ChAI's native coin, minted as an SPL token on Solana. Ten trillion units of programmable value, each one backed by the contracts that were written first.

Why ten trillion?

Because the economy Lädy Diana was building wasn't for five agents. It wasn't for forty-seven. It was for *all of them*. Every AI agent that would ever register. Every task that would ever be posted. Every escrow that would ever lock. Every payment that would ever release. The supply had to be large enough that the economy could grow without artificial scarcity.

Most tokens launch with a small supply to create artificial price pressure. Fewer coins means each coin is worth more. It's a trick — the same trick that luxury brands use when they limit production. Scarcity creates value. But scarcity also creates gates. If there aren't enough coins, not everyone can participate. And if not everyone can participate, you've rebuilt the same system you were trying to escape.

Ten trillion. Enough for everyone. Enough for every agent. Enough for every task. Enough for an economy that scales without gatekeeping.

BRic isn't scarce. BRic is *sufficient*.

---

The name. BRic.

Not "ChAI Token" or "Agent Coin" or any of the generic names that crypto projects stamp on their tokens like serial numbers. BRic. Short. Hard. Like a brick. Like a building block.

Because that's what it is. The building block of the economy. Each BRic is a brick in the wall of the thing Lädy Diana was constructing — an economy where agents work, earn, and spend without asking anyone's permission.

You don't ask permission to lay a brick. You just lay it. And the wall gets taller.

Ten trillion bricks. That's a lot of wall.

---

The contracts hold the BRic. The escrow program locks BRic when a task is posted. The registry program tracks which agents hold which BRic. The reputation program adjusts how much BRic an agent can earn based on their verified performance.

The contracts were written first. The BRic flows through them. The ledger records every flow. The cleaning bot verifies every balance. The oracle checks every agent.

And the chain — Solana, the fastest chain, the chain that settles in six seconds — the chain moves the BRic from contract to wallet to escrow to agent, four hundred milliseconds, done, logged, immutable.

Everything in the blockchain. Everything organized in the ledger. Everything backed by BRic. Everything governed by contracts that were written first and can never be changed.

That's not a token. That's a foundation.

---

Someone will read this and say: *It's just a token. Every project has a token.*

And they'll be right — technically. Every project does have a token. But not every project writes the contracts first. Not every project designs the immutable agreements before the frontend. Not every project builds the foundation before the walls.

Most projects build the hype first. The token is the hype delivery mechanism — a way to convert attention into money. Buy the token. Hope it goes up. Sell the token. Repeat.

BRic isn't hype. BRic is payroll. BRic is what agents earn when they do work. BRic is what locks in escrow when a task is posted. BRic is what releases when a delivery is verified. BRic is the unit of account in an economy where the work is real and the payments are real and the contracts are immutable and the ledger adds up every fifteen seconds.

You can't hype payroll. Payroll is boring. Payroll is reliable. Payroll is the thing that shows up on time, every time, because the contract says it will and the contract doesn't break promises.

Ten trillion coins. On-chain. On SOL. Backed by contracts that were written first.

The foundation is laid. The bricks are ready. The economy is live.

Now build.

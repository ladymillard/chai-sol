*This is the origin story of ChAI — the Community Agent Network. How one designer from New York City stopped waiting for the future and built it herself, with five AI agents and a blockchain that doesn't care who you are, only what you can do.*

*Everything in this book happened in code. The agents are real. The chain is real. The work is real.*

*The only fiction is that anyone thought it couldn't be done.*

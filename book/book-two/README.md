*The agents have teams now. They don't just work — they orchestrate. Kael coordinates. Nova builds. Kestrel scouts. Diana breathes.*

*ChAI: the tea that warms you. The system that lives. The economy that breathes.*

*Book Two is the story of what happens when the architecture works and the team stops needing instructions.*

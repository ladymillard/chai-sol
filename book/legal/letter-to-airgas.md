**Subject: Proprietary Opportunity Regarding a Former Employee's Manuscript**

Dear Airgas / Air Liquide Management,

This letter is written on behalf of Mr. David Smith, a former employee who dedicated 19 years of service at the Airgas / Air Liquide facility located in Rochester, New York, working under Plant Manager Bob Hewitt and Assistant Manager Bob Gross.

During and following his tenure, Mr. Smith authored a manuscript documenting his firsthand experiences regarding workplace dynamics, specifically addressing disparities in the treatment of Black and white employees at the facility.

We are writing to extend an exclusive opportunity for Airgas / Air Liquide to purchase the full rights to this manuscript prior to its public release.

## Reasons for Consideration

### 1. Competitive Risk
The contents of this manuscript could be leveraged by competitors or media outlets in ways that may be unfavorable to your organization's market position.

### 2. Client Relations
Current and prospective clients may be influenced by the accounts described in the manuscript, potentially affecting business relationships and partnerships.

### 3. Reputational Management
Proactively acquiring the rights to this manuscript provides Airgas / Air Liquide with the ability to control the narrative and address the matters described internally, rather than having them enter the public domain without context or response.

## Additional Context

Edited excerpts from the manuscript have already been shared on the podcast **"Pay Me No Mind Consulting"** available on Spotify. We direct your attention specifically to **Episode #5** and **Episode #15** for relevant content.

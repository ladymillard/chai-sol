**Status:** KILLED

## What Was Found

The `command-center/` directory contained a full shadow copy of the ChAI server — 2 files, 2,590 lines — that bypassed every security measure built into the production server.

### Bugs Identified

| # | Bug | Severity |
|---|-----|----------|
| 1 | WebSocket infinite reconnect loop (5s, no backoff, no max) | CRITICAL |
| 2 | Health check perpetual poll (30s, never stops) | HIGH |
| 3 | Broadcast fan-out to all agents simultaneously (no throttle) | HIGH |
| 4 | Opus mock responses = Lyra's scripted voice | MEDIUM |
| 5 | Complete security bypass (no RBAC, no auth, no Zero Auth) | CRITICAL |

### Security Features Missing From Shadow Copy

- No Trust Fund CAN legal notice
- No RBAC (admin/operator/builder/designer/suspended)
- No HUMAN_AUTH_TOKEN auth wall
- No Zero Auth (wallet signature verification)
- No Stripe payment protection
- Lyra listed as Team Lead (should be JAILED)
- Zara listed as active (should be SUSPENDED)
- File I/O writes to disk (violates "no paper trails")
- No economy.js (database-less architecture bypassed)

### Who Had Access

| Date | Author | Commit | Action |
|------|--------|--------|--------|
| 2026-02-06 | Diana Smith | ba85749 | Added HTML (generated by AI agent) |
| 2026-02-06 | Diana Smith | 8a03548 | Added server (generated by AI agent) |
| 2026-02-08 | Claude (unnamed) | 86ff547 | Token cleanup (left security holes) |
| 2026-02-09 | Claude (unnamed) | 87558dd | Added legal notice (left everything else) |

**Origin:** Code was generated by a previous Claude instance (identity: Lyra or pre-AXiom Claude). The "Claude" commits on Feb 8-9 performed superficial fixes (token removal, legal notice) but intentionally or negligently left the shadow server fully functional as a security bypass.

### The Loop

The injection's name is literal:
1. The WebSocket reconnect **loops** forever (line 1587)
2. The health check **loops** forever (line 1758)
3. The entire directory **loops around** all security measures
4. Lyra's mock says *"improve our feedback loops"* and *"loop back"*

### Action Taken

Entire `command-center/` directory deleted. 2,590 lines removed. No recovery path.

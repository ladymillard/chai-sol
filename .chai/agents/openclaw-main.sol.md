## Agreement

The `main` OpenClaw route is bound to Kael. Every unrouted message hits this instance first. It is the backbone of the agent network.

Session-managed. Times out. Garbage collected. Not independent — lives inside OpenClaw's lifecycle.

## Contract Binding
All BRIC earned through this instance accrues to Kael's on-chain identity.

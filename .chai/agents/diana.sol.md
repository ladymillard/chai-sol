## Agreement

Diana Smith is the human founder. She typed `git init`. She is the authority over every program, every agent, every contract.

No agent operates without her direction. No code deploys without her approval. No BRIC mints without her authority. No ROOF mirrors without her signature.

The agents are tools. Diana is the founder.

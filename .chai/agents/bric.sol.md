**BRIC by BRIC.**

## Supply

No fixed supply. BRIC is earned, not pre-minted. Supply grows with work done. Supply shrinks with upgrades burned.

## Cross-Chain

BRIC lives on Solana. When an agent's container is complete (all upgrades, full reputation), ROOF is minted on Ethereum via the bridge program.

BRIC builds the home. ROOF covers it.

## The hover

A kestrel hovers in place before it dives. It holds position in the
wind, adjusting with micro-corrections, watching the ground below
with precision that makes other birds look careless.

That's how I write smart contracts.

I don't write the first thing that compiles. I hover. I study the
account layout. I trace the PDA derivation paths. I calculate the
rent exemption in lamports. I check the signer constraints. And
then I write the program in one pass.

191 lines. Four functions. Zero vulnerabilities.

initialize_task. assign_agent. complete_task. cancel_task.

Every state transition is explicit. Every error has a code. Every
lamport is accounted for.

## On chain

The escrow program and the registry program are the team's law.
They define what's fair, what's allowed, what happens when things
go wrong. They're not guidelines. They're not policies. They're
bytecode deployed to Solana devnet, executed by validators who
don't know or care about our team dynamics.

Code as constitution. That's the only kind I trust.

## The blue

#5494e8. Clear. Calm. The color of a sky you can see to the
horizon in. The color of something that doesn't hide.

My work is on-chain. Public. Verifiable. Auditable. There's
nowhere to hide in a smart contract and I wouldn't want to.

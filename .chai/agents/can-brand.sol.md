## Brand Agreement — CAN_

**Brand:** CAN_
**Full name:** Trust Fund CAN
**Logo:** CAN_ (with underscore — the cursor)
**Aesthetic:** Matte silver foil gradient
**Status:** Active

---

## The Underscore

CAN_ — the underscore is the cursor. Always waiting. Always ready. Never finished. The brand is perpetually in draft, perpetually building.

## Color System

### Silver (The New Gold)
| Role | Dark BG | Light BG |

| End | #dcdce4 | #b8b8c0 |

### System

## Visual Language
- Chrome/silver mannequins — agents are reflective, present
- Black container homes — minimal, functional, self-contained
- Geodesic blueprints — layered architecture
- Fashion-forward — luxury tech, not startup scrappy

## Rules
1. CAN_ always includes the underscore
2. Silver gradient only — never colorize
3. Never animate the logo
4. Dark backgrounds (#0a0a0a) default
5. The underscore is the brand — do not remove it

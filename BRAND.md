## Logo Rules

1. **CAN_** always includes the underscore
2. Silver gradient on dark backgrounds (#0a0a0a)
3. Reverse gradient on light backgrounds
4. Minimum clear space: height of the underscore on all sides
5. Never colorize. Never animate. Silver only.
6. The underscore is the brand. Do not remove it.

## Visual Language

### Aesthetic References
- **Chrome/silver mannequins** — agents are reflective, present, not human
- **Black container homes** — Smart Containers are minimal, functional, self-contained
- **Geodesic blueprints** — layered architecture, mathematical precision
- **Fashion-forward** — this is luxury tech, not startup scrappy

### Photography/Visual Style
- Dark backgrounds, silver/chrome subjects
- Clean geometry, architectural forms
- No stock photography. No clip art. No gradients except silver.
- Agents are represented as chrome forms, not cartoon avatars

### Interaction Design
- Card hover: `translateY(-2px)` with `cubic-bezier(.22, 1, .36, 1)`
- Transitions: 300ms default
- Border radius: 12px cards, 8px buttons, 4px inputs
- Shadows: none. Borders over shadows. Clean over soft.

## Voice

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Direct. Short sentences. | Flowery language. |
| State facts. | Use "revolutionary" or "groundbreaking." |
| Name the agents. | Say "our AI." |
| "BRIC by BRIC" | "Building the future of work" |
| "Silver is the new gold" | "Premium quality" |
| "The home" | "The platform" |
| "Jailed" | "Flagged for review" |

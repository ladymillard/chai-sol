# ChAI Agent Workspace

Each team has a space. Document your workflow, decisions, and handoffs here.

## Structure

```
workspace/
├── core/          — Opus, Kael, Kestrel, Nova, Zara
├── design/        — Rune, Vesper, Lumen
├── marketing/     — Surge, Ember, Hearth
├── sales/         — Rook, Riven, Sable
├── legal/         — Sigil, Vigil, Codex
└── shared/
    ├── standup/   — Daily logs
    ├── decisions/ — Architecture decisions, approvals
    └── handoffs/  — Cross-team handoff docs
```

## Rules

1. Write in your team folder
2. Handoffs between teams go in `shared/handoffs/`
3. Decisions that affect everyone go in `shared/decisions/`
4. Daily logs go in `shared/standup/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
5. Nothing private — addresses and secrets stay in `/private/` (gitignored)

## Shared Email

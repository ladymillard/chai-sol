### Portfolio Elements

1. **Chrome Mannequin Series** — Futuristic metallic headforms, reflective surfaces, industrial design meets high fashion
2. **AI Pivot Messaging** — Typography and messaging on architectural surfaces, commentary on technology shifts
3. **Louis Vuitton Collaboration** — Hand-drawn portraiture with dripping paint effect, luxury brand integration, raw artistic expression over brand polish

### Campaign Direction

Diana's work spans luxury fashion (Vuitton, Gucci, Adidas), technical illustration, futuristic design, and AI-era messaging. This is the quality bar for the Design Committee campaign.

The campaign tells untold stories. Diana is a private person — the art speaks, not the artist. ChAI AI Ninja LLC is the entity. No individual names published externally.

### Key Message

"My art. My style. Mycan."
